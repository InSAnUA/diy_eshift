DIY E-Shift is a easy to build electronic derailleur built with open source tools. It has been tested with the RD-4500 Shimano Tiagra derailleur, but the general method should work with most Shimano parts. This project contains:

* Arduino sketch
* Electronic schematics with Fritzing diagram and bill of materials
* CAD drawings for the servo mount

Step by step instructions can be found on instructables.com soon.

Planned Improvements
--------------------

* EEPROM wear levelling
* Waterproofing
* Machined servo brakets
